Hi there 👋
I'm a front-end focused developer who specialises in JavaScript. I have over 8 years experience creating and optimising web UI's, apps and deliverables. I mainly work with React and Vue, and headless software in the web.

Things I've Worked On:

🏦 - Lead Fintech MVP Front End creation for an Identification app 

🧑‍🎨 - SME Design Consultancies and built ✨beautiful✨ web applications for brands and orgs like London School of Buisness

🛒 - Created and contributed to lots of different eCommerce applications.

Things I Want to Work On:

Web applications which are altruistic in their nature and backed by a passionate, honest team who accept each others strengths and weakness, and who prefer to think for themselves and not follow fads. I want to help solve real world problems -- faced by everyday people, and I want to do it with a tech stack that has great defaults. A tech stack which is as decouplable, delcarative, and easy to work with as possible. It's my experience that tech like that allows a team to create freely and happily, whilst avoiding pitfalls and bugs.

Where I Work Well:

In remote-first autonomous teams where I can learn, and teach new things! I like a diverse range of people, from different places and cultures, and I enjoy the abstract thinking which that can ignite. I work well in product teams where I can focus and create, iteratively. I seek out management and colleagues that coach, mentor and collaborate with empathy.

Hobbies:

I play 🎸 guitar. I like to cook (mostly Mediterranean and Asian cuisine). I have a 🐈 and I like to take long walks along the beach where I live, as well as the woods and hills nearby. That's when I can get tear myself away from coding or playing PGA Tour on PS5. Currently I'm learning TypeScript . When I grow up I want to write books and work 3 days a week.
